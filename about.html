    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <p>
      The Better Internet Foundation<sup>✴︎</sup> was founded in 2020 with a broad—but critical—purpose:
    </p>
	<p class="quote">
		“To support the development of resilient and humane software infrastructures and to fund projects and people that develop non-extractive peer-to-peer technologies that promote Internet freedom.”
	</p>
	<h2>In 2021</h2>
    <p>
      We were initially focused on the maintenance and core development of <a href="http://www.radicle.xyz" target="_blank">Radicle</a>—a sovereign peer-to-peer network for code collaboration, built on top of Git—and <a href="http://www.drips.network" target="_blank">Drips</a>—a decentralized toolkit for individuals and projects to support their software dependencies. Both projects seek to empower, secure, and embed resilience in the development of open source software, which is often <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/" target="_blank">underfunded</a> and dependent on centralized platforms susceptible to <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/15000-go-module-repositories-on-github.html" target="_blank">attacks</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/github-youtube-dl-takedown-isnt-just-problem-american-law" target="_blank">censorship</a>.
    </p>
	<h2>At the end of 2022</h2>
    <p>
      We started to receive grants from <a href="http://www.radworks.org" target="_blank">Radworks</a>: a networked organization and community dedicated to cultivating Internet freedom. We were initially provided with a grant to continue managing the development of Radicle and Drips protocols, before Radworks started to support these projects directly in <a href="https://community.radworks.org/t/formal-review-start-the-foundation-org/3280" target="_blank">2023</a>. Since then, we have continued to provide strategic and operational support to Radworks and the technologies in its ecosystem (including Radicle and Drips). More information on accessing Radicle and Drips technologies can be found <a href="/access.html">here</a>.
    </p>
	<h2>In 2025</h2>
    <p>
		We have continuously adapted our focus, to bring value to the Radworks Ecosystem in the areas it is best suited for. In 2025, this means leading work that drives consistency and risk-mitigation through the Ecosystem. To learn more, see our <a href="/work.html">current work</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Foundation is governed by its Council, which is made up of Eleftherios Diakomichalis, Gabriela Mäder, and Ange Royall-Kahin (President).
